# PlinkoBoard

This project is meant to simulate running trials through a "plinko board" to find the probability of a given result using MATLAB.


A plinko board is explained on this website:   https://priceisright.fandom.com/wiki/Plinko

A plinko board is a board with rows of evenly spaced pegs that are offset from each other. 
To play a game on the board, a chip is dropped from a space between a set of pegs at the top of the board. 
The chip will hit pegs at each row and fall into an open space adjacent to the peg. 
The chip eventually reaches the bottom of the board where each space is marked with a value.
The goal of the game is to have the chip fall in the space marked with the highest value. 

Further instructions for this game are provided in the "Instructions" file of this repo.
